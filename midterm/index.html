         <p>Walter White is a chemistry genius but works as a chemistry teacher at a high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer and given a prognosis of two years to live.
            To ensure that his pregnant wife and disabled teenage son have a financial future, he uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature "blue meth," he teams up with Jesse Pinkman,
            a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother-in-law, Hank. As Walter and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walter becomes a dangerous criminal, and Jesse becomes 
            a hot-headed salesman. Hank is always hot on his tail, forcing Walter to devise new ways to cover his tracks.</p>
